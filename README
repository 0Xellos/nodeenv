Node.js virtual environment
===========================

``nve`` (node.js virtual environment) is a tool to create 
isolated node.js environments.

It creates an environment that has its own installation directories, 
that doesn't share libraries with other node.js virtual environments.


Install
-------

You can install nve with ``easy_install nve``, or from the `git
repository <https://github.com/ekalinin/nve>`_ or from a `tarball
<https://github.com/ekalinin/nve/tarball/master#egg=env-dev>`_
``easy_install nve==dev``.


Usage
-----

The basic usage is::

    $ python nve.py ENV

If you install it you can also just do ``nve ENV``.
